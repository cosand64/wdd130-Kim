    <p>“Drop the Guillotine” is one of Peach Pit’s breakout tracks, blending jangly guitar riffs, nostalgic vocals, and bittersweet storytelling. Released in 2016, the song captures the feeling of emotional detachment in a fading relationship, told through frontman Neil Smith’s signature mix of vulnerability and sarcasm.
The lyrics reflect a passive breakup, where one person slowly pulls away while the other is left confused and aching. Phrases like “She says I don't look the same” highlight the emotional distance, while the title metaphor — “drop the guillotine” — implies a sudden, clean ending, even if it’s not what the narrator wants.</p>

    <p>“Shampoo Bottles” is a melancholic, slow-burning indie rock song by Peach Pit that dives deep into the loneliness and emotional residue of a breakup. Released in 2020 as part of their album You and Your Friends, the song captures the raw feeling of being haunted by everyday reminders of someone who’s no longer there.
The lyrics revolve around the narrator finding their ex’s belongings—like shampoo bottles left in the shower—and how these seemingly mundane objects trigger a wave of grief, longing, and helplessness. It's a quiet but powerful look at how breakups linger not just emotionally, but physically in the spaces we share.</p>

    <p><a src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICNtZKmQGMw">Alrighty Aphrodite</a></p>
    <p>“Alrighty Aphrodite” is a woozy, emotionally rich indie track that explores the tension between desire and self-worth in a complicated relationship. Released in 2017 on their debut album Being So Normal, the song paints a picture of someone entangled with a partner who’s emotionally unavailable or using them—but they stick around anyway.
The title references Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love and beauty, suggesting the person being addressed is alluring and powerful—but maybe also manipulative or distant. Lyrics like “Don’t you call my name” and “She’ll give you love, just as long as you don’t love her” highlight the one-sided dynamic and emotional push-pull at the heart of the song.</p>
