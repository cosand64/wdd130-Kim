            Peach Pit is a Canadian indie rock band from Vancouver, British Columbia, known for their blend of dreamy guitar pop, heartfelt lyrics, and laid-back slacker vibes. Formed in 2014, the band’s sound combines surf rock, jangle pop, and emotional storytelling, often centered on themes like love, nostalgia, and awkward youth.
            Their music is instantly recognizable thanks to Neil Smith’s wistful vocals and Christopher Vanderkooy’s shimmering lead guitar work, supported by Peter Wilton (bass) and Mikey Pascuzzi (drums). Together, they create an atmosphere that feels both melancholic and sunny—like crying in the summer with sunglasses on.
            Their breakout came with the 2017 album Being So Normal, followed by critically appreciated projects like You and Your Friends (2020) and From 2 to 3 (2022). Known for their DIY aesthetic, quirky music videos, and relatable songwriting, Peach Pit has built a strong global fanbase and a reputation for fun, intimate live shows.
